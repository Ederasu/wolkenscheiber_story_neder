Once upon a time, in the small town of Raesfeld, there lived a man who enjoyed peaceful walks through the village.
One day, he was passing by a new baeckerei (bakery) and decided he would go inside. He could smell the fresh gebaecks inside and was feeling a little bit hungry. As he entered, the cool breeze from the Klimaanlage greeted him, offering a pleasant escape from the warm afternoon sun.
He browsed for a moment, then finally decided he would buy an apfelkuchen.
